### 📌 Project Overview
This repository contains a full **Bank Database** built from scratch using MySQL.  
It is organized into progressive labs from basic table creation to advanced querying with joins and window functions.

### 🗂️ Database Tables

| Table | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `Customers` | Customer personal information |
| `Accounts` | Account details linked to customers |
| `Transactions` | Deposit / Withdraw records |
| `Branches` | Bank branch information |
| `Loans` | Loan details linked to customers |
